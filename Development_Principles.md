# Development Principles

|Principle|Objective|
|:-|:-|
|Patients and public centred|The infrastructure development will be focused on delivering benefits to patients and the wider public and building confidence and trust in how data is accessed and used in research and innovation. All development will actively engage patients and the public throughout.|
|User-design led|The experience for our user community is paramount.  All development will follow best design practices, actively engage the user communities throughout and be developed in the open to enable continuous user feedback. The design will be delivered as "Design as Code" to demonstrate working capability.|
|Agile development|Adopt agile development processes and tools to allow us to deliver exemplars quickly and then build on that experience.  At each stage test our approach based on how well it supports our research and innovation user community.|
|Open first|Support open standards throughout our delivery.  Use open-source where possible and share the developed technology assets openly under a permissive licence.|
|Modular and extensible|Requirements and tools will evolve.  All capability will be integrated through open and documented APIs.|
|Cloud-first|Deploy to Public Cloud by default falling back to on-premise private cloud only where compute or storage makes this significantly more cost-effective.|
|Reuse|Work with open source and our academic and commercial partners to enable reuse whenever possible.  New development should be the exception, not the default.|
|Build in the 'ities' from Day One|Architect for interoperability, scalability, reliability, availability and security throughout the development.  This is a production environment and not a research project.|

## Principles for Participation

Every organisation involved in the development of infrastructure commits to:

1. Demonstrate active and ongoing engagement with patients and the public in the design, development and governance of their activities involving health data to provide assurance that these activities are in the public interest.

2. Encourage the availability and use of structured and unstructured health and care data, including clinical, administrative, imaging, genomic and other molecular data, for research and innovation that serves public interest purposes, while promoting the protection of privacy and data security in line with the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Health Data Governance1.

3. Make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable by adopting the FAIR Guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship2.

4. Adhere to the Foundation Principles and Core Elements for Responsible Data Sharing set out in the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data3 and use a proportionate approach to the governance of data access based on the five "safes"4.

5. Maximise the benefits of data for research and innovation through non-preferential access to data for uses that serve the public interest, by ensuring that data remains available to, and accessible by, any organisation (concurrently or otherwise) provided the five "safes" criteria are met and the organisation meets the access requirements of he data custodian.

6. Work collaboratively to increase harmonisation and reduce the complexity of data sharing arrangements to improve the efficiency of accessing data for trustworthy and ethical   research and innovation purposes. This includes making the terms of access clear, such as expected timescales and costs, and being transparent about the type and quality of data available.

7. Contribute to a joined-up international COVID-19 offer for researchers in all sectors by collaborating with existing, relevant health research infrastructure.

### The FAIR Guiding Principles

Wilkinson, M. D. et al. The FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. Sci. Data3:160018 doi: 10.1038/sdata.2016.18 (2016)

To be Findable:

- F1. (meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
- F2. data are described with rich metadata (defined by R1 below)
- F3. metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data it describes
- F4. (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

To be Accessible:

- A1. (meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardized communications protocol
    - A1.1 the protocol is open, free, and universally implementable
    - A1.2 the protocol allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary
- A2. metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

To be Interoperable:

- I1. (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
- I2. (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
- I3. (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

To be Reusable:

- R1. meta(data) are richly described with a plurality of accurate and relevant attributes o R1.1. (meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
    - R1.2. (meta)data are associated with detailed provenance
    - R1.3. (meta)data meet domain-relevant community standards

### Foundational Principles

Foundation Principles and Core Elements for Responsible Data Sharing set out in the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data. https://www.ga4gh.org/genomic-data-toolkit/regulatory-ethics-toolkit/framework-for-responsible-sharing-of-genomic-and-health-related-data/#fp

- Respect Individuals, Families and Communities
- Advance Research and Scientific Knowledge
- Promote Health, Wellbeing and the Fair Distribution of Benefits
- Foster Trust, Integrity and Reciprocity

## Core Elements for Responsible Data Sharing

It is good practice for those involved in genomic and health-related data sharing to have core elements of responsible data sharing in place. The following Core Elements of the Framework aid in the interpretation of the Foundational Principles to individuals and organizations involved in the sharing of genomic and health-related data. The Core Elements should be interpreted in a proportionate manner that acknowledges different levels of risk and community cultural practices. This Framework applies to use of data that have been consented to by donors (or their legal representatives) and/or approved for use by competent bodies or institutions in compliance with national and international laws, general ethical principles, and best practice standards that respect restrictions on downstream uses.

|Principle|Objective|
|:-|:-|
|Safe projects|Is this use of the data appropriate?|
|Safe people|Can the users be trusted to use it in an appropriate manner?|
|Safe settings|Does the access facility limit unauthorised use?|
|Safe data|Is there a disclosure risk in the data itself?|
|Safe outputs|Are the statistical results non-disclosive?|
